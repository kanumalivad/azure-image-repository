# azure-image-repository

This is a simple project that retrive and upload images to the azure blob storage and you can also search images by keyword(here i used image name as a keyword).

Prerequisite
  1) create a blob storage on azure portal 
  2) create a container in that.
  3) create sql database
  4) create table (create table img_links(link varchar(500));)
  5) add your client ip in sql database server's firewall settings.
  
  That's it. :)
